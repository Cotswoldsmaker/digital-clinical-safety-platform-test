# CWC teaching module steps

## Intro to the app
* Install VS code
* Create github account
* Fork the the clinical-saffety-hazard-documentation repo from github
* Show final app running on own computer

## Now build the app from scratch whilst learning about coding along the way
* Build a Docker-compose.yaml file to start up environment
* May need separate Dockerfiles to build container environments
* Log into container with
>> docker exec -it docs-builder bash
* Good reading resource - https://realpython.com/django-setup/
* Create a new django project
>> django-admin startproject cshd
* Jump into the newly created project
>> cd ./cshd
* Create a new django app
>> python3 manage.py startapp app
* Start up the basic Django app and then go to http://0.0.0.0:8000
>> python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
* Close down the server with ctrl-c
* Follow https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/
* or perhaps https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/
* in cshd/cshd/settings.py add 'app' to the INSTALLED_APPS list.
>> pip install tzdata
* Some Django writing up
* Add NHS styling and javascript for reacting
* Install Materials for mkdocs (in mkdocs dir)
>> mkdocs new .
* Test out
>> mkdocs serve


--------
* pip freeze to get requirements and copy into requirements.txt file
>> pip freeze
* mypy to check for typing
* Learn python
* Write python with PEP8 styling (to improve readability) - https://realpython.com/python-pep8/
* Linter for better styling
* mypi for hint type checking 
* Add a devcontainer.json - here you can add what python version you want for linters and so on
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle

Notes:
If Docker cannot build the container (eg "network [network long name] not found), try this:
>> docker-compose up --force-recreate -d

# Notes:

You cannot have variables (eg {{ variable_name}}) inside the metadata of markdown files for mkdocs. Mkdocs does not recognise the format and shows the meta data on the broswer screen.

You need to add github secrets for updating issue labels

You may need to set up github actions as well to run script to update labels above
